# HelloWorld
My first coding project!

## About this Project
In this repository, I will complete my very first coding lab: a simple "Hello World" webpage. I am a student currently learning about Github, Codespaces, and Pages. While these were required as part of my GIS programming course, I hope to utilize this knowledge to complete my own fun projects outside of the classroom.
There are 2 files in this repository, this README that you are currently viewing, and the HTML file in which I am hosting my webpage.
- `README.md`
- `index.html`

## What I Learned
In this lab, I created a GitHub repository to understand how version control works, I used Codespaces to write the HTML code for the webpage, I explored basic HTML and CSS for styling, and I finally published the page through GitHub Pages to understand how web hosting works.
